About me
Hi everyone)
My name is Larisa, I am a 4th year student of BRU, specializing in mechatronics and robotics. I had an internship at a machine-building enterprise as a design engineer. At the university I successfully mastered such programs as: Compass, autocad, solidworks, NX. I am attracted to 3D-models, and I independently studied Maya. I constantly try not to stand still and develop, so the specialty is necessary corresponding:), also I am fond of and love programming. Mastered independently a year of python.
